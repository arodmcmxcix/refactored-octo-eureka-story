Once a opon a time, 
There was a young boy in a small town in the outskits of Paris France.
The King order a new law that all young men would have to try for the royal
courts as servants. The young boy, tried to tell his father and mother of
the horrors he heard of how the king had treated the lowly court servants. 
His father was determined to stand up for his son, but on the fateful day
he confronted the King it was order that the boy's parents were to be executed
for treason on the word of the King. 

On the day of the execution, the boy became determined to save his parents.
However, he needed to find a way to avoid the King's guards in order to save
them. But how? Thinking to himself, he realized that in order to save his 
parents, he needed to be able to sneak in undetected. Thinking hard, he 
realized that he needed to find a way to get a guards uniform to be 
successful.

He tried to sneaked into a guards' room to steal a uniform, and ran away as fast as possible. He ran and ran, ran and ran, until he found himself in a dark zone.

"Why hello there," a shadowy figure said, "you want to make a deal?"
The boy was shocked at the presence of someone else in the room,
for he could see nobody. The presence, as if only a shadow, loudle proclaimed
"I can save your parent's life if you swear fealty to me, and forever denounce
the king." The boy knew he needed to pick his words carefully now.
